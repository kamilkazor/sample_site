# :evergreen_tree: Sample Site
Sample Site is my web-dev training project. My main goal was to create responsive layout with a nice mobile menu. Additionally on "Hall of Dogs" page you can see an implementation of Dog API in form of a simple gallery. Empty1 and Empty2 pages have no content, but some might be added in future. Their main purpose for now is to make navbar doesn't look too empty.  You can try it on https://kamilkazor.github.io/sample_site/
