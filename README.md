# :evergreen_tree: Sample Site
Sample Site is my web-dev training project. My main goal was to create responsive layout with a nice mobile menu. Additionally on "Hall of Dogs" page you can see an implementation of Dog API in form of a simple gallery. Empty1 and Empty2 pages have no content, but some might be added in future. Their main purpose for now is to make navbar doesn't look too empty.  You can try it on https://kamilkazor.github.io/sample_site/

## ‚ùï Known issues:
By default mobile menu is hidden when you enter the site, but if you open and close it or enter one of the links and then resize the window you can see hiding animation after shrinking to mobile size. Not a big problem since you rather not resize the window on mobile, but that effect can be observed after changing screen orientation.

The smalles supported width is 280px (galaxy fold). Bolow that point layout doesn't scale well.
